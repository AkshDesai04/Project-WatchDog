# Project WatchDog  

## About the project  
This is a security project meant for checking in on what the device has been used to do.  
It can be used as a parenting tool or even a tool to check what your classmate did with your laptop when he took it for making his "presentation"  

### Need for the project  
  
### How it works?  
The project works with 2 major inputs.  
1. Screenshots  
2. Webcam  
The project takes the above mentioned inputs at a regular interval  
It then runs face recognition on the webcam input and locks the device upon detection of an unauthorized face.  
Every screenshot and webcam input are saved in a folder on the device.  
All of the above mentioned tasks happen on a single thread so as to minimize the impact on the device's performance.  

### Dependencies  
The project in it's current state has the following dependencies...
1. OpenCV
2. face_recognition
